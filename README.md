# Streamify

Streamify is a frontend application that displays an analytics dashboard for a fictional music streaming service called "Streamify." The dashboard presents key metrics and data visualizations, allowing the service's management team to gain insights into user activity, revenue, and content performance. The goal is to build a functional and visually appealing dashboard that is both responsive and user-friendly.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
